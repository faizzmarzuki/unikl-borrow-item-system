# unikl-borrow-item-system

Universiti Kuala Lumpur Borrowing Item System.

This is my internship project in Universiti Kuala Lumpur MITEC. The system use PHP, HTML, JS, MySQL and Jquery.

This project consist 3 users such as student, staff and lecturer. Login pages for all 3 users are different. The reasons behind of the different login page because of all 3 users have different permissions on the system. For example, student can only insert data and view the data inside the system. The system will only display the data of the student who login into the system. For lecturer, they will see the data of the student that has been approved by the admin. While admin can view staff and student data for borrowing item.
